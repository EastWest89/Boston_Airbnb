# Boston Airbnb Data

## Objective

This is one of the projects in Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. The data is from kaggle open resources (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). There are three business questions to answer based on the provided data set.
1. What is the trend of the listing price over the time? <br>
2. What affects the price most considering number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square feet and overall reviews? <br>
3. How does the location, property type, room type and bed type impact the listing price?

## Library used:
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn

## Files used (from kaggle open resouces):
1. listing.csv
2. calendar.csv
3. reviews.csv

## Language and Framework:
python3, jupyternotebook

## Observations from the Data
1. Majority of the listing price is less than $500, and the average price has decreased from 2016-09 to 2017-01, which is caused by the significant increase in the number of listings.
2. The listing price is positively correlated to the accommondates, bedrooms, and square feet.
3. Leather district, downtown, and south boston waterfront have relatively higher listing prices than the other neighbourhood.
4. Special types of property, such as guesthouse, boat, and some others show higher median price than the regular properties.
5. Listings of entire home or real beds are relatively higher in price.
